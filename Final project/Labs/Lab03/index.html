        <h3>My First Webpage</h3>
        <p>
            At first, making my first webpage felt confusing because there were so many tags 
            and rules to follow. Once I learned how HTML works, it started to make sense, 
            and I realized how much control I have over how a page looks. Creating this page 
            helped me understand how websites are built step by step.
        </p>

        <h3>What I Learned</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>How to use HTML tags to organize a page.</li>
            <li>How to make lists and headings look neat.</li>
            <li>How to add links that open in a new tab.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>More About My Experience</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML is easier than I expected once I practiced.</li>
            <li>Writing code by hand helped me remember the tags.</li>
            <li>I learned the importance of validating my code to fix errors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps I Followed</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>I created a folder called Lab03 in my CSIT121 folder.</li>
            <li>I made a new file named index.html and added HTML code.</li>
            <li>I tested my file in a browser to make sure it displayed correctly.</li>
            <li>I validated my code with the W3C validator and fixed the errors.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>First Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                In Lab 02, I learned how to create a basic HTML page using headings, paragraphs, 
                and links. I practiced structuring a webpage properly and began to understand how 
                coding standards make content easier to read and maintain. This lab helped me build 
                the foundation of web development.

            <h2>Second Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                In Lab 03, I learned how CSS can transform the appearance of a webpage by separating 
                content from design. Using selectors, colors, and styling made my pages look more 
                organized and visually appealing. I also discovered the importance of using classes 
                and IDs for layout, organization, and reusability.
