            <h3>My First Webpage</h3>
            <p>At first, making my first webpage felt confusing because there were so many tags
               and rules to follow. Once i learned how HTML works, it started to make sense,and
               i realized how much control i have over how a page looks. Creating this page 
               helped me understand how websites are built step by step.</p>

            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>How to use HTML tags to organise a page.</li>
                <li>How to make lists and headings look neat.</li>
                <li>How to add links that open in a new tab.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>More About My Experience</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>HTML is easier than I expected once i practiced.</li>
                <li>Writing codes by hand helped me remember the tags..</li>
                <li>i learned the importance of validating my code to fix errors.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Steps I Followed</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>I created a folder called lab02 in my CSIT121 folder.</li>
                <li>I made a new file named index.html and added HTML code.</li>
                <li>I tested my file in a browser to make sure it displayed correctly.</li>
                <li>I validated my code with the W3C validator and fixed the errors.</li>
                <li>I uploaded my folder to GitHub and published it.</li>
            </ol>

                <h2>first reflecton</h2>
                <p>In Lab02, I have how to create a basic HTML page with headings, paragraph, and
                   links.I practised structuring a webpage properly, and i began to see how coding
                   standards make content easy to read and maintain. This lab helped me understand
                   the foundation of web development.</p>

                <h2>Second reflection</h2> 
                <p> Since Lab02, I have learned how CSS can transform the appearance of a
                    webpage by separating content from design. Using selectors, colors,
                    and text styling makes my pages more visually appealing. I also
                    discovered the importance of using classes and IDs for organization
                    and reusability</p>
