  <h1>Website Evaluation: Chelsea FC</h1>

  <h2>URL of the Website</h2>
  <p>https://www.chelsefc.com</p>

  <h2>Name of the Website</h2>
  <p>Chelsea Football Club Official Website</p>

  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  <p>The site is made for those who supports chelseafc, and also a big fan of chelsea football club.</p>

  <h2>Site Organization</h2>
  <p>Basically, this site has a simple layout with a menu that comprises of  Men's team, Women's team, Latest, Ticket & Hospitality etc. It shows recent tories on the home page.</p>

  <h2>CRAP Design Principle Example</h2>
  <p>Repetition is used in the color theme and layout. Every page uses the same blue and white design and text style.</p>

  <h2>Accessibility Audit Score</h2>
  <p>WAVE Accessibility Checker score: around 32%. The site has around 47 accessibility issues. Some of the issues include interactive buttons and
    links that are not properly labeled for screen readers, and some headings that are not in the right order. These issues can make it harder for 
    blind or low-vision users to navigate the site</p>

  <h2>Site Effectiveness</h2>
  <p>The website gives access to player details, match results, and club news. It helps users find what they need easily.</p>

  <h2>Site Efficiency</h2>
  <p>It loads very well on phones and computers. The top menu makes it simple to move between pages.</p>

  <h2>Engagement</h2>
  <p>Images, videos, and stories make the site interesting and fun for the chelseafc fans. it allows fans to wnat to scroll more.</p>

  <h2>Recommendation</h2>
  <p>I think the website could be improved by reducing the number of large images 
     and videos on the homepage.it sometimes feels a little too busy, which can 
     make it hard to focus on one thing. If they made the layout simpler and added 
     clearer text labels, it would be easier for everyone to use, including people 
     with disabilities.</p>
