    <p>PNG is used for logos because it keeps edges sharp and allows for transparent backgrounds. This makes 
       it easy to place a logo on any design or surface without a white box appearing behind it.</p>

    <p>PNG is also used for screenshots, icons, and online graphics. pictures saved as PNG stay clear and are easy to read, 
       which is helpful for tutorials or instructions.</p>

    <p> You can also use PNG for your wallpapers and digital art because the colors stay strong and the details remain sharp.
        as you can see from the example i showed you, this pictures can be used for wallpaper on phones and laptps.
