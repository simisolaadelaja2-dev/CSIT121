    <p>PNG (Portable Network Graphics) is an image format that keeps  picture quality clear and sharp. 
       It dosen't lose quality when it is saved or downloaded, which makes it different from formats 
       like JPEG.</p>

    <p>One of the most important features of PNG is that it supports transparent backgrounds. This means a PNG 
       image can be placed on any design or webpage without showing a colored box around it. This makes it perfect 
       for logos, icons, and graphics.</p>

    <p>Another advantage of PNG is its ability to display small details clearly. Whether it contains text, shapes, or 
       fine lines, a PNG file keeps everything crisp. PNG is also easy to download and transfer between two devices 
       without losing quality.</p>
