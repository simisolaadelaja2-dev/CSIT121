    <p>PNG is important because it keeps images looking clear and high-quality. Many websites and designers use 
       PNG when they need clear graphics that does not look blurry or bad. This helps gives pages clean and 
       professional look.</p>

    <p>The support for transparency also makes PNG useful. You can place a PNG image on any background without 
       getting a colored box behind it. This flexibility makes PNG better than formats that do not support 
       transparency.</p>

    <p>Another reason PNG is important is that it works on all devices and browsers. Whether someone is using a phone, 
       tablet, or computer, PNG images display the same way. This consistency makes the format reliable for web and 
       digital use.</p>
