  <h2>Project Table — All 10 Labs</h2>
  <p>Below is a summary of the ten labs I completed during this course. Each lab built on the previous work and helped me master different parts of front-end development.</p>

  <article>
    <h3>lab 01</h3>
    <p>
       In this lab, I downloaded and edited an HTML file, previewed it in a browser, checked it for errors, and then uploaded it to a web server so it could be viewed online. This taught me the basic steps of publishing a webpage.

    <h3>lab 02</h3>
    <p>
        In Lab 02, you practice writing HTML by hand using a text editor. You create a simple blog-style webpage that reflects what you’ve learned so far about web standards and HTML. The final page should look similar to the example provided, but with your own content.

    <p>
        In this lab, you update your Lab 03 blog page to make it responsive. You create a single-column layout for mobile devices, a multi-column layout for desktops using flexbox, grid, or media queries, and add link anchors for easy navigation within the page.

    <h3>lab 06</h3>
    <p>
        In this lab, you evaluate the usability of a public website using UI/UX principles you learned, including organization, navigation, CRAP design principles, and accessibility. You choose a non-eCommerce, informational website and assess how well it follows web design best practices.

    <h3>lab 07</h3>
    <p>
        In this lab, you build a two-page website: one page uses an HTML table to create a tier list, and the other page includes a form to collect user input. Both pages are styled with CSS for accessibility and consistency.

    <h3>lab 10</h3>
    <p>
        In this lab, I created a multipage website that teaches the class about the PNG web standard. I explained what PNG is, why it is used on the web, and its main features like lossless compression and transparency. The site uses proper structure tags, follows accessibility guidelines, and is designed using the CRAP principles.

  <h2>Lessons Learned Reflection</h2>
  <p>
    This project had a mix of challenges and successes for me. I struggled at times with getting my links, images, and CSS to work correctly, but fixing those issues helped me understand HTML and CSS much better. One of my biggest triumphs was seeing all my pages come together into a working website that I built on my own. Overall, this project taught me patience, problem-solving, and how to organize my files while creating a functional and clean website.
  </p>
  
  <h2>Observations</h2>
  <p>
   This project had both challenges and successes. I struggled with organizing my files and fixing display issues, but solving them helped me understand HTML and CSS better. Testing my website on different browsers and devices showed me how layouts can change, which taught me the importance of checking compatibility. Overall, building the site improved my problem-solving skills and gave me a clearer idea of how real websites are created and tested.
